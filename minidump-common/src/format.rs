//! Minidump structure definitions.
//!
//! Types defined here should match those defined in [Microsoft's headers][msdn]. Additionally
//! some [Breakpad][breakpad] and [Crashpad][crashpad] extension types are defined here and should
//! match the definitions from those projects.
//!
//! # Type Layouts
//!
//! This library isn't a "proper" minidump-sys library because it doesn't use repr attributes
//! to force Rust to layout these structs identically to how they're laid out in memory.
//!
//! The reasons for this are 3-fold:
//!
//! 1. It isn't necessary because we specify how to serialize/deserialize things with `scroll`
//!    via `derive(Pread, Pwrite)` which uses the declared field order and not the in-memory
//!    layout, and assumes everything is packed anyway, which as a rule, minidump types are.
//!    Specifically they're packed to align 4, but Microsoft is mercifully very attentive to
//!    its type layouts so we're not aware of anywhere where packing to align 1 would change
//!    offsets. Packing is mostly just there so 32-bit and 64-bit definitely agree on offsets.
//!
//! 2. We would have to mark several types as `repr(packed(4))`, making them dangerous to use
//!    as several of the fields would become misaligned. This would create a bunch of
//!    unnecessary and brittle `unsafe`.
//!
//! 3. It's not *actually* that useful to have structs with precise in-memory layouts since
//!    a minidump parser needs to accept both little-endian and big-endian minidumps, and
//!    is therefore swizzling the bytes of all the values anyway. Also it's dangerous to
//!    reinterpret a pile of memory as arbitrary types without validation!
//!

///
/// # The XSTATE Format in Minidumps
///
/// This format is slightly messed up in the context of minidumps because it's
/// grafted onto Microsoft's own formats. Here's what's important to know:
///
/// * The "Cpu Context" and the "XSAVE context" are in fact the same regions
///   of memory.
///
/// * Whether XSTATE is present or not, the classic layouts of CONTEXT_X86
///   and [`CONTEXT_AMD64`] both apply -- xstate will only add stuff after *or*
///   refine your understanding of memory in the existing layout. So you can
///   safely ignore the existence of XSTATE, but you might be missing new info.
///
/// * AMD64 doesn't have a standard way to save general purpose registers,
///   so the first 256 bytes of [`CONTEXT_AMD64`] are just however microsoft
///   decided to save the registers, and will not be referred to by the XSTATE.
///
/// **!!! THIS PART IS IMPORTANT !!!**
///
/// * As a consequence, all [`XSTATE_FEATURE::offset`] values must have 256
///   added to them to get the correct offset for that feature! For example, the
///   LEGACY_FLOATING_POINT feature should always have an offset of 0, but it
///   is actually at offset 256 in [`CONTEXT_AMD64`] (it corresponds to
///   [`CONTEXT_AMD64::float_save`]).
///
/// * The following features are already contained inside of [`CONTEXT_AMD64`]:
///    * LEGACY_FLOATING_POINT
///    * LEGACY_SSE
///    * GSSE_AND_AVX
///
/// * If there are XSTATE entries that *actually* map outside of the context's
///   normal memory range, then the context's [`context_flags`](`CONTEXT_AMD64::context_flags`)
///   will have bit 0x40 set ([`CONTEXT_HAS_XSTATE`]).
///
/// * [`ContextFlagsCpu::from_flags`] will mask out the [`CONTEXT_HAS_XSTATE`] bit.
///   If you want to check for that bit, check the raw value of
///   [`context_flags`](`CONTEXT_AMD64::context_flags`).
