# minidump-stackwalk CLI manual

> This manual can be regenerated with `minidump-stackwalk --help-markdown please`

Analyzes minidumps and produces a report (either human-readable or JSON)

### Usage:

```
minidump-stackwalk [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <minidump> [--] [symbols-path]...
```

### Arguments
#### `<MINIDUMP>`
Path to the minidump file to analyze

#### `[SYMBOLS_PATH_LEGACY]...`
Path to a symbol file. (Passed positionally)

If multiple symbols-path-legacy values are provided, all symbol files will be merged into minidump-stackwalk's symbol database.

### Options
#### `--human`
Emit a human-readable report (the default)

The human-readable report does not have a specified format, and may not have as many details as the JSON format. It is intended for quickly inspecting a crash or debugging rust-minidump itself.

Can be simplified with --brief

#### `--json`
Emit a machine-readable JSON report

The schema for this output is officially documented here: <https://github.com/rust-minidump/rust-minidump/blob/master/minidump-processor/json-schema.md>

Can be pretty-printed with --pretty

#### `--cyborg <CYBORG>`
Combine --human and --json

Because this creates two output streams, you must specify a path to write the --json output to. The --human output will be the 'primary' output and default to stdout, which can be configured with --output-file as normal.

#### `--dump`
Dump the 'raw' contents of the minidump

This is an implementation of the functionality of the old minidump_dump tool. It minimally parses and interprets the minidump in an attempt to produce a fairly 'raw' dump of the minidump's contents. This is most useful for debugging minidump-stackwalk itself, or a misbehaving minidump generator.

Can be simplified with --brief

#### `--features <FEATURES>`
Specify at a high-level how much analysis to perform

This flag provides a way to more blindly opt into Extra Analysis without having
to know about the specific features of minidump-stackwalk. This is equivalent to
ProcessorOptions in minidump-processor. The current supported values are:

* stable-basic (default): give me solid detailed analysis that most people would want
* stable-all: turn on extra detailed analysis.
* unstable-all: turn on the weird and experimental stuff.

stable-all enables: nothing (currently identical to stable-basic)

unstable-all enables: `--recover-function-args`

minidump-stackwalk wants to be a reliable and stable tool, but we also want to be able
to introduce new features which may be experimental or expensive. To balance these two
concerns, new features will usually be disabled by default and given a specific flag,
but still more easily 'discovered' by anyone who uses this flag.

Anyone using minidump-stackwalk who is *really* worried about the output being stable
should probably not use this flag in production, but its use is recommended for casual
human usage or for checking "what's new".

Features under unstable-all may be deprecated and become noops. Features which require
additional input (such as `--evil-json`) cannot be affected by this, and must still be
manually 'discovered'.

\[default: stable-basic]  
\[possible values: stable-basic, stable-all, unstable-all]  

#### `--verbose <VERBOSE>`
How verbose logging should be (log level)

The unwinder has been heavily instrumented with `trace` logging, so if you want to debug why an unwind happened the way it did, --verbose=trace is very useful (all unwinder logging will be prefixed with `unwind:`).

\[default: error]  
\[possible values: off, error, warn, info, debug, trace]  

#### `--output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>`
Where to write the output to (if unspecified, stdout is used)

#### `--log-file <LOG_FILE>`
Where to write logs to (if unspecified, stderr is used)

#### `--no-color`
Prevent the output/logging from using ANSI coloring

Output written to a file via --log-file, --output-file, or --cyborg is always --no-color, so this just forces stdout/stderr printing.

#### `--pretty`
Pretty-print --json output

#### `--brief`
Provide a briefer --human or --dump report

For human: Only provides the top-level summary and a backtrace of the crashing thread.

For dump: Omits all memory hexdumps.

#### `--no-interactive`
Disable all interactive progress feedback

We'll generally try to auto-detect when this should be disabled, but this is here in case we mess up and you need it to go away.

#### `--evil-json <EVIL_JSON>`
**UNSTABLE** An input JSON file with the extra information.

This is a gross hack for some legacy side-channel information that mozilla uses. It will hopefully be phased out and deprecated in favour of just using custom streams in the minidump itself.

#### `--recover-function-args`
**UNSTABLE** Heuristically recover function arguments

This is an experimental feature, which currently only shows up in --human output.

#### `--use-local-debuginfo`
Use debug information from local files referred to by the minidump, if present

#### `--symbols-url <SYMBOLS_URL>`
base URL from which URLs to symbol files can be constructed

If multiple symbols-url values are provided, they will each be tried in order until
one resolves.

The server the base URL points to is expected to conform to the Tecken
symbol server protocol. For more details, see the Tecken docs:

#### `<https://tecken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`

Example symbols-url values:
* microsoft's symbol-server: <https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/>
* mozilla's symbols-server: <https://symbols.mozilla.org/>

#### `--symbols-cache <SYMBOLS_CACHE>`
A directory in which downloaded symbols can be stored

Symbol files can be very large, so we recommend placing cached files in your system's temp directory so that it can garbage collect unused ones for you. To this end, the default value for this flag is a `rust-minidump-cache` subdirectory of `std::env::temp_dir()` (usually /tmp/rust-minidump-cache on linux).

symbols-cache must be on the same filesystem as symbols-tmp (if that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry about it, you're probably not doing something that will run afoul of it).

#### `--symbols-tmp <SYMBOLS_TMP>`
A directory to use as temp space for downloading symbols.

A temp dir is necessary to allow for multiple rust-minidump instances to share a cache without race conditions. Files to be added to the cache will be constructed in this location before being atomically moved to the cache.

If no path is specified, `std::env::temp_dir()` will be used to improve portability. See the rust documentation for how to set that value if you wish to use something other than your system's default temp directory.

symbols-tmp must be on the same filesystem as symbols-cache (if that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry about it, you're probably not doing something that will run afoul of it).

#### `--symbols-download-timeout-secs <SYMBOLS_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECS>`
The maximum amount of time (in seconds) a symbol file download is allowed to take

This is necessary to enforce forward progress on misbehaving http responses.

\[default: 1000]  

#### `--symbols-path <SYMBOLS_PATH>`
Path to a symbol file.

If multiple symbols-path values are provided, all symbol files will be merged into minidump-stackwalk's symbol database.

#### `-h, --help`
Print help (see a summary with '-h')

#### `-V, --version`
Print version
