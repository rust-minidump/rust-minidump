minidump-stackwalk 0.10.3
Analyzes minidumps and produces a report (either human-readable or JSON).

USAGE:
    minidump-stackwalk [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <minidump> [--] [symbols-path]...

ARGS:
    <minidump>
            Path to the minidump file to analyze.

    <symbols-path-legacy>...
            Path to a symbol file. (Passed positionally)
            
            If multiple symbols-path-legacy values are provided, all symbol files will be merged
            into minidump-stackwalk's symbol database.

OPTIONS:
        --json
            Emit a machine-readable JSON report.
            
            The schema for this output is officially documented here:
            https://github.com/rust-minidump/rust-minidump/blob/master/minidump-processor/json-
            schema.md

        --human
            Emit a human-readable report (the default).
            
            The human-readable report does not have a specified format, and may not have as many
            details as the JSON format. It is intended for quickly inspecting a crash or debugging
            rust-minidump itself.

        --cyborg <cyborg>
            Combine --human and --json
            
            Because this creates two output streams, you must specify a path to write the --json
            output to. The --human output will be the 'primary' output and default to stdout, which
            can be configured with --output-file as normal.

        --dump
            Dump the 'raw' contents of the minidump.
            
            This is an implementation of the functionality of the old minidump_dump tool. It
            minimally parses and interprets the minidump in an attempt to produce a fairly 'raw'
            dump of the minidump's contents. This is most useful for debugging minidump-stackwalk
            itself, or a misbehaving minidump generator.

        --features <features>
            Specify at a high-level how much analysis to perform.
            
            This flag provides a way to more blindly opt into Extra Analysis without having to know
            about the specific features of minidump-stackwalk. This is equivalent to
            ProcessorOptions in minidump-processor. The current supported values are:
            
            * stable-basic (default): give me solid detailed analysis that most people would want
            * stable-all: turn on extra detailed analysis.
            * unstable-all: turn on the weird and experimental stuff.
            
            stable-all enables: nothing (currently identical to stable-basic)
            
            unstable-all enables: `--recover-function-args`
            
            minidump-stackwalk wants to be a reliable and stable tool, but we also want to be able
            to introduce new features which may be experimental or expensive. To balance these two
            concerns, new features will usually be disabled by default and given a specific flag,
            but still more easily 'discovered' by anyone who uses this flag.
            
            Anyone using minidump-stackwalk who is *really* worried about the output being stable
            should probably not use this flag in production, but its use is recommended for casual
            human usage or for checking "what's new".
            
            Features under unstable-all may be deprecated and become noops. Features which require
            additional input (such as `--evil-json`) cannot be affected by this, and must still be
            manually 'discovered'.[default: stable-basic] [possible values: stable-basic, stable-
            all, unstable-all]

        --output-file <output-file>
            Where to write the output to (if unspecified, stdout is used)

        --log-file <log-file>
            Where to write logs to (if unspecified, stderr is used)

        --verbose <verbose>
            Set the logging level.
            
            The unwinder has been heavily instrumented with `trace` logging, so if you want to debug
            why an unwind happened the way it did, --verbose=trace is very useful (all unwinder
            logging will be prefixed with `unwind:`).[default: error] [possible values: off, error,
            warn, info, debug, trace]

        --pretty
            Pretty-print --json output.

        --brief
            Provide a briefer --human report.
            
            Only provides the top-level summary and a backtrace of the crashing thread.

        --evil-json <evil-json>
            **[UNSTABLE]** An input JSON file with the extra information.
            
            This is a gross hack for some legacy side-channel information that mozilla uses. It will
            hopefully be phased out and deprecated in favour of just using custom streams in the
            minidump itself.

        --recover-function-args
            **[UNSTABLE]** Heuristically recover function arguments
            
            This is an experimental feature, which currently only shows up in --human output.

        --symbols-url <symbols-url>
            base URL from which URLs to symbol files can be constructed.
            
            If multiple symbols-url values are provided, they will each be tried in order until one
            resolves.
            
            The server the base URL points to is expected to conform to the Tecken symbol server
            protocol. For more details, see the Tecken docs:
            
            https://tecken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
            
            Example symbols-url value: https://symbols.mozilla.org/

        --symbols-cache <symbols-cache>
            A directory in which downloaded symbols can be stored.
            
            Symbol files can be very large, so we recommend placing cached files in your system's
            temp directory so that it can garbage collect unused ones for you. To this end, the
            default value for this flag is a `rust-minidump-cache` subdirectory of
            `std::env::temp_dir()` (usually /tmp/rust-minidump-cache on linux).
            
            symbols-cache must be on the same filesystem as symbols-tmp (if that doesn't mean
            anything to you, don't worry about it, you're probably not doing something that will run
            afoul of it).

        --symbols-tmp <symbols-tmp>
            A directory to use as temp space for downloading symbols.
            
            A temp dir is necessary to allow for multiple rust-minidump instances to share a cache
            without race conditions. Files to be added to the cache will be constructed in this
            location before being atomically moved to the cache.
            
            If no path is specified, `std::env::temp_dir()` will be used to improve portability. See
            the rust documentation for how to set that value if you wish to use something other than
            your system's default temp directory.
            
            symbols-tmp must be on the same filesystem as symbols-cache (if that doesn't mean
            anything to you, don't worry about it, you're probably not doing something that will run
            afoul of it).

        --symbol-download-timeout-secs <symbol-download-timeout-secs>
            The maximum amount of time (in seconds) a symbol file download is allowed to take.
            
            This is necessary to enforce forward progress on misbehaving http responses. [default:
            1000]

        --symbols-path <symbols-path>
            Path to a symbol file.
            
            If multiple symbols-path values are provided, all symbol files will be merged into
            minidump-stackwalk's symbol database.

    -V, --version

NOTES:

Purpose of Symbols:

  Symbols are used for two purposes:

  1. To fill in more information about each frame of the backtraces. (function names, lines, etc.)

  2. To do produce a more *accurate* backtrace. This is primarily accomplished with call frame
information (CFI), but just knowing what parts of a module maps to actual code is also useful!

Supported Symbol Formats:

  Currently only breakpad text symbol files are supported, although we hope to eventually support
native formats like PDB and DWARF as well.

Breakpad Symbol Files:

  Breakpad symbol files are basically a simplified version of the information found in native
debuginfo formats. We recommend using a version of dump_syms to generate them.

  See:

    * mozilla's dump_syms (co-developed with this program): https://github.com/mozilla/dump_syms
