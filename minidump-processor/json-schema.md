# rust-minidump JSON Schema

This document details the current JSON Schema for minidump-processor's and minidump-stackwalk's JSON output.

**As of the publishing of this document, the schema is stable**, but will have backwards compatible additions in the future. Stability guarantees only apply to crates.io releases, so if you build an unpublished version of rust-minidump, it may include things that can be removed before the next release. At the moment minidump-processor and minidump-stackwalk are versioned and published in lockstep (even when only one of them has been modified), so when this document refers to a particular "version" of the schema, it's the published version of these two crates.

**The Most Important Rule Of This Schema:** *Assume all fields are optional, and can be null or absent.* This includes top-level Objects which define subfields (like "modules" or "threads"). Minidumps are inherently "best-effort" and very modular &mdash; Information that we would *like* to use may be corrupt or missing, and rust-minidump has to do the best with what it has. Some information may also be platform-specific (e.g. `mac_crash_info`), so we may omit it when it doesn't make sense.

In the current implementation some data is always required and some fields always get populated, but we'd prefer to not specify this because in principle rust-minidump should always be trying to produce whatever it can whenever it can, which means making *more* things optional.

So when we say the schema is "stable" we are really just saying that we aren't going to rename fields or change their type (int, string, object...) or semantics. And of course we'll always do our best to populate an existing field when the required data is available! While we can *technically* deprecate a field and stop emitting it completely under this definition of "stable", we will try to avoid doing this unless there is some significant issue with the field (or it never contained a useful value anyway).

# Optional Analyses

As we add more experimental and unreliable analyses (like trying to recover function args, trying to detect bitflips, trying to detect exploitable crashes, etc.) they may be hidden behind flags in minidump-stackwalk or [ProcessorOptions](https://docs.rs/minidump-processor/latest/minidump_processor/struct.ProcessorOptions.html).

The default configuration will be fairly conservative, and our strictest stability guarantees can only be given for that configuation. If you opt into a feature that's marked **\[UNSTABLE\]**, its presence and representation in the schema is also unstable. These fields will be marked as `[UNSTABLE:my_feature_name]` in the schema, where `my_feature_name` is the name of the option in ProcessorOptions, and `--my-feature-name` is the name of the feature in minidump-stackwalk.

Features are grouped under three families which can be used for bulk enabling:

* stable_basic (`--features=stable-basic`): the default configuration, guaranteed stable, always there. All fields in the schema are stable_basic unless otherwise stated (In the future some stable-basic features may be made optional, but they will still be enabled by default.)

* stable_all (`--features=stable-all`): also guaranteed stable, but disabled by default.

* unstable_all (`--features=unstable-all`): unstable, may change or be removed.


# Types

Standard JSON types apply, which we will use as follows:

* `<u32>` (unsigned 32-bit integer)
* `<f32>` (IEEE 32-bit floating-point)
* `<bool>`
* `<string>`
* `<array>`
* `<object>`

**All of these can also be `null`, see "The Most Important Rule Of This Schema" above.**

(Arrays and objects will just be represented by the appropriate kind of braces.)

By default, strings are *opaque* to this schema, meaning they can contain anything (including the empty string). This usually means we are just passing the string through from a symbol file or the minidump itself. There may be an underlying structure from the source, but we aren't going to try to guarantee or specify it.

Some strings do however have more structure:

* `<hexstring>` - a string containing a hexadecimal integer that will fit into a `u64` (ex: "0x000af123"). These are usually pointers. We serialize these values as strings instead of json integers for a few reasons:
  * Although *on paper* JSON supports infinite precision integers, this is dubious because JavaScript itself (and many other languages) are built around Doubles which do not support that full range
  * Although this format is for machine-use first and foremost, humans often have reasons to read it, and this makes those values easier to read/scan for notable details. For similar reasons we also *try* to 0-pad hexstring values to the crashing platform's native width.
  * Feeding the JSON into indexing/sorting/reporting infrastructure is easier, because at every step the values are represented in the format that humans prefer for pointers.

* `"ENUM" | "Variants" | "like" | "these!"` - When there are only a limited number of values a field can contain, we will try to list them all off. However, because this schema is *descriptive* of the contents of a minidump, new features may necessitate new variants (for instance, new kinds of hardware and operating systems can happen). **Do not assume enums are exhaustive.**




# Schema

NOTE 1: Ordering of the fields is generally arbitrary, but they are roughly ordered in decreasing
importance/reliability. So e.g. `crash_info`, `system_info`, and `threads` contain the most
important information, and it would be very surprising if they were ever null.

NOTE 2: If the current implementation *supports* emitting a field but doesn't have the data
necessary to populate it, it will generally prefer emitting an explicit `null` over omitting the
field. Although sometimes the empty string is also used for this purpose (we may
try to tighten that up in future releases if it's an issue).

NOTE 3: Minidumps can be generated regardless of if there's an actual crash, but for simplicity
these notes will assume that a crash happened by default, since that's the important case.

NOTE 4: This schema isn't completely "normalized" and includes some information that *technically*
you could compute from the other data in the schema. To make it clear that these fields aren't
trying to capture any special situation, it will often be indicated that they're "redundant".
Redundant data is included to make the format more human-friendly and to try to reduce the
need for post-processing &mdash; especially when rust-minidump needs to compute that information
anyway.
