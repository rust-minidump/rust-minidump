    // Ok so there exists 3 kinds of stackframes in ARM64:
    //
    // * stackless leaves
    // * stackful leaves
    // * normal frames
    //
    //
    // # Normal Frames
    //
    // Let's start with normal frames. In the standard calling convention, the following happens:
    //
    // lr := return_address   (performed implicitly by ARM's function call instruction)
    // PUSH fp, lr            (save fp and lr to the stack -- ARM64 pushes in pairs)
    // fp := sp               (update the frame pointer to the current stack pointer)
    //
    // So to restore the caller's registers, we have:
    //
    // pc := *(fp + ptr)      (this will get the return address, usual offset caveats apply)
    // sp := fp + ptr*2
    // fp := *fp
    //
    // Note that although we push lr, we don't restore lr. That's because lr is just our
    // return address, and is therefore essentially a "saved" pc. lr is caller-saved *and*
    // automatically overwritten by every CALL, so the callee (the frame we're unwinding right now)
    // has no business ever knowing it, let alone restoring it. lr is generally just saved
    // immediately and then used as a free general purpose register, and therefore will generally
    // contain random garbage unrelated to unwinding.
    //
    //
    // # Leaf Functions
    //
    // Now leaf functions are a bit messier. These are functions which don't call other functions
    // and therefore don't actually ever need to save lr or fp. As such, they can be entirely
    // stackless, although they don't have to be. So calling a leaf function is just:
    //
    // lr := return_address
    // <possibly some pushes, but maybe not>
    //
    // And to restore the caller's registers, we have:
    //
    // pc := lr
    // sp := sp - <some arbitrary value>
    // fp := fp
    //
    // Unfortunately, we're unaware of any way to "detect" that a function is a leaf or not
    // without symbols/cfi just telling you that. Since we're in frame pointer unwinding,
    // we probably don't have those available! And even if we did, we still wouldn't know if
    // the frame was stackless or not, so we wouldn't know how to restore sp reliably and might
    // get the stack in a weird state for subsequent (possibly CFI-based) frames.
    // Also, if we incorrectly guess a frame is a leaf, we'll also use a probably-random-garbage
    // lr as a pc and potentially halluncinate a bunch.
    //
    //
    // # Conclusion
    //
    // At the moment we think it's safest/best to just always assume we're unwinding a normal
    // frame. Statistically this is true (most frames are, even if they happen to be at the
    // top of the stack when we crash), and if the frame *is* a leaf then our `fp` is likely
    // to be the correct fp of the next frame. This will effectively result in us unwinding
    // our caller instead of ourselves, causing the caller to be omitted from the backtrace
    // but otherwise perfectly syncing up for the rest of the frames.

    //
    // We lack some of the proper context to implement the "strip" primitive, because
    // the amount of bits that are "real" pointer depends on various extensions like
    // pointer tagging and how big page tables are. If we allocate too many bits to
    // "real" then we can get ptr_auth bits in our pointers, and if we allocate too
    // few we can end up truncating our pointers. Thankfully we'll usually have a bit
    // of margin from pointers not having the highest real bits set.
    //
    // To help us guess, we have a few pieces of information:

    // * We *can* know the page mappings (MemoryInfo)
